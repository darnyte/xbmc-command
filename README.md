xbmc-command
============

A simple terminal XBMC command client. Connects to the XBMC Mediacenter via
TCP and sends JSON-RPC requests. The client is not interactive and can only
run one command per execution.

It can handle tasks like 'volume up' or 'play youtube video'.
See the help for all available commands.
