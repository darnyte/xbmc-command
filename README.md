xbmc-command
============

A simple terminal XBMC command client. Connects to the XBMC Mediacenter via
TCP and sends JSON-RPC requests. The client is not interactive and can only
run one command per execution.

It can handle tasks like 'volume up' or 'play youtube video'.
See the help for all available commands.

Installation
------------

run `# python setup.py install` in the root directory of this repository.

Arch Linux users can use the PKGBUILD-git file to create a package.

    $ wget https://raw.github.com/mychris/xbmc-command/master/PKGBUILD-git
    $ makepkg -p PKGBUILD-git

If you want to use plyr, the lib must be installed (no runtime error if the
module is not found). See Optional Dependencies.

A configuration file can be used to specify the host, port and timeout.
It should be installed in ROOT/usr/share/doc/xbmc-command/xbmc-command.cfg.
Just copy it to ~/.config/xbmc-command.cfg and set the preferences.

-----

    $ xbmc-command --help
